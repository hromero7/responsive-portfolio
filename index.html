              <p class="main-bio">I was born in Glendora, CA on October 10, 1995. I graduated from UCR in 2017 with a Bachelor's in Marketing.
                  Shortly after graduating college, I began working in Temecula for a Marketing agency.
                  I was able to work with some of the most prestigious companies in the world. After working there for almost
                  a year, I decided it was time to pursue a different career.
              </p>
      
              <p class="main-bio">I left the company in June 2018 and took some time off. I began working again in March 2019 for a different
                  company in Norco.
                  I am currently still employed with this company.</p>
      
              <p class="main-bio">I decided to attend the UCR Coding Boot Camp in order to completely change my career and open up other opportunities for growth within my current job. I am looking to pursue a career in software and web development. As a UCR grad, I believe attending the UCR Coding Boot Camp program was the right fit, since I am already familiar with UCR. I am excited for what this program will help me achieve in my professional career. </p>
